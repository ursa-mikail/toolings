## Benchmark Metrics

1. **Time (s):** Total execution time for the algorithm.
2. **CPU Usage (%):** CPU resources utilized during execution.
3. **Memory Usage (bytes):** Peak memory usage during execution.

## Plot Overview

The benchmark results are visualized using a multi-axis plot:
- **Bar Graph:** Represents execution time.
- **Line Graph (Green):** CPU usage.
- **Line Graph (Red):** Memory usage.

Below is a sample plot generated by the benchmarking tool:
