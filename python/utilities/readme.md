## Config Setup Utility

To set up basic work, there should be a basic guide akin questionnaire which users can map for basic functional work to a json format. This should also be seen in the tool console. With that, we can have a direct minimal set-up based on what the tool may require for basic work. This will minimize the misconfiguration that will get in the way to just get it to work and obviate the searching for options in their console.
